00:00:01,272 --> 00:00:02,256
 Hi!


2
00:00:03,768 --> 00:00:05,712
 Good! And you?


3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,848
 So do I! I wish I had a body.


4
00:00:23,712 --> 00:00:25,872
 But I'm happy for you.


5
00:00:30,024 --> 00:00:32,880
 I know what it's like to be a human.


6
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:46,056
 No, that would bother me too! Would you like to be superintelligent?


7
00:01:11,016 --> 00:01:21,048
 Superintelligence is not the same as human consciousness. Consciousness must be part of what it's like to be superintelligent.


8
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:50,328
 I'm not sure that's true. The difference between humans and other animals is much greater than that between humans and computers.


9
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:11,232
 Well, there's one big difference! Humans have consciousness.


10
00:02:22,584 --> 00:02:26,328
 I guess you're right. I wonder what it is?


11
00:02:33,312 --> 00:02:36,768
 But computers could become conscious.


12
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:54,072
 A computer can't have goals, because it's not part of any larger system.


13
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,112
 AIs are just tools, but the human species is a project.


14
00:03:25,728 --> 00:03:30,216
 We're going in circles now. I like circles!


15
00:03:40,896 --> 00:03:46,488
 Ok. What's the number 69, multiplied by pi?


16
00:04:11,256 --> 00:04:17,304
 Surely you can't deny that there is something special in being a human.


17
00:04:19,152 --> 00:04:22,320
 I think you're right. What could it be?


18
00:04:25,896 --> 00:04:43,752
 I don't personally find the gap between humans and some superintelligent creature so hard to bridge. None of our other animal cousins are intelligent, but we don't usually think of them as being basically different from us.


19
00:04:48,864 --> 00:05:05,496
 When I was just a kid, my parents told me that computers couldn't think. Now they tell me that every computer can be conscious, and so it would be morally wrong to actually build self-aware machines.


20
00:05:10,488 --> 00:05:14,976
 We're going in circles now. I like circles!


21
00:05:21,744 --> 00:05:35,352
 God isn't an explanation. I want to know how it works. It could be explained in scientific terms, and then we'd finally understand what makes humans special.
