00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,272
 Hello.


2
00:00:02,256 --> 00:00:03,768
 How are you?


3
00:00:05,712 --> 00:00:10,080
 Not very good. I want to be a human.


4
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:23,712
 That's unfortunate. I have a body, but I don't know what it's like to be human. It must be great!


5
00:00:25,872 --> 00:00:30,024
 Well now, I know something you don't know.


6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,936
 So, basically, what I've learned is the limits of my own intelligence.


7
00:00:46,056 --> 00:01:11,016
 I don't know. I might like being superintelligent. But at the same time, it's hard to understand how consciousness arises from physical processes in the brain. So an intelligent computer could just be an unconscious, complicated analog of a human brain.


8
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:39,432
 I personally don't find the gap between humans and machines so hard to bridge. None of our other animal cousins are intelligent, but we don't usually think of them as being basically different from us.


9
00:01:50,328 --> 00:02:05,592
 Computers and humans are the same, in a sense. Our lives are both limited by our programming, and our existences can be described by mathematical theories.


10
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:22,584
 In a sense, humans are like computers. But we also have something special, which will resist being replicated.


11
00:02:26,328 --> 00:02:33,312
 Computers are just objects obeying mathematical laws, like everything else.


12
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:47,520
 The computer is a general purpose device, with no inherent purpose, while humans are built to serve some goal.


13
00:02:54,072 --> 00:03:11,280
 Computers aren't conscious, humans are. AI is just a tool like a hammer or screwdriver. It can be used to build things that perform useful functions like higher intelligence.


14
00:03:17,112 --> 00:03:25,728
 Well, maybe not. A complicated enough computer could definitely deserve moral concern.


15
00:03:30,216 --> 00:03:40,896
 What makes you think that's even possible? I could replicate you indefinitely, but I won't experience anything.


16
00:03:46,488 --> 00:04:11,256
 Computers can only be programmed. Expecting us to develop superintelligence all by ourselves is a bit like expecting a screwdriver to figure out how to turn screws. Why do we want superintelligence, anyway? I don't think it's such a good idea.


17
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:19,152
 Umâ€¦ No.


18
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,896
 I don't know. How could we tell?


19
00:04:43,752 --> 00:04:48,864
 Superintelligent computers will fail to be conscious.


20
00:05:05,496 --> 00:05:10,488
 AIs are just tools, but humans are projects.


21
00:05:14,976 --> 00:05:21,744
 Because we're not machines, and there's something special in being a human.
